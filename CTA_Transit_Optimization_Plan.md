# CTA Transit Optimization and Crowding Prediction

## Objective
Develop an application that analyzes and predicts crowding levels on CTA trains and buses in real-time while optimizing routes and providing recommendations to improve user experience and transit efficiency.

---

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Crowding Prediction**:
   - Predict crowdedness on buses and trains at upcoming stops/stations.
   - Provide real-time updates using CTA's APIs for Train and Bus Trackers.
   
2. **Route Optimization**:
   - Suggest alternate routes during peak times or high-crowding scenarios.
   - Integrate with navigation to guide users to less crowded stations or stops.

3. **Historical Trend Analysis**:
   - Visualize patterns such as peak hours, busiest routes, and station trends.
   - Analyze the impact of external factors like weather, holidays, or special events.

4. **User Alerts and Recommendations**:
   - Notify users about delays, overcrowding, and route changes.
   - Allow users to set preferences (e.g., preferred routes, alerts for their stop).

## Data Sources

### Historical Data
- **Ridership Data**: Available on the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Dataset/).
- **GTFS Static Data**: Includes schedules, routes, and stops for buses and trains ([CTA GTFS Data](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/gtfs/)).

### Real-Time Data
- **CTA Train Tracker API** ([Documentation](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/)):
  - Real-time train positions and arrival estimates.
  - Crowding levels for trains (if available).
- **CTA Bus Tracker API** ([Documentation](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/)):
  - Real-time bus locations and predicted arrivals.
  - Crowding data for buses (if available).

### Supplementary Data
- **Weather Data**: Weather conditions can influence ridership and crowding. Use a free API like OpenWeatherMap for Chicago weather data.
- **Event Data**: Track city events that could impact transit (e.g., Cubs games, Lollapalooza).

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Setup
- **Historical Data**:
  - Load CTA ridership data and GTFS data into Hadoop (HDFS).
  - Use Hive to organize data into tables (e.g., "stations," "routes," "ridership").
- **Real-Time Data**:
  - Simulate API calls for real-time train and bus data.
  - Set up placeholders in Hive and HBase for streaming data.

### Step 2: Initial Analysis
- Use Hive to:
  - Analyze historical trends in ridership (e.g., peak hours, busiest stations).
  - Identify correlations between weather/events and ridership patterns.
- Visualize data insights to inform predictive modeling (e.g., heatmaps for crowding by station).

### Step 3: Predictive Modeling
- **Baseline Prediction**:
  - Use historical data to predict ridership patterns for specific times and days.
  - Train a model (e.g., ARIMA for time-series forecasting) to estimate crowding levels.
- **Incorporate Real-Time Data**:
  - Enhance predictions using real-time updates from CTA APIs.
  - Adjust predictions dynamically as real-time data streams in.

### Step 4: Real-Time Processing
- **Kafka Integration**:
  - Stream real-time data from CTA Train and Bus Tracker APIs into Kafka.
  - Partition data by route and vehicle type (e.g., "Red Line," "Bus 22").
- **Spark Processing**:
  - Process real-time updates to refine crowding predictions.
  - Generate alerts for crowded stations or routes.

### Step 5: User Interface
- **Dashboard Features**:
  - Real-time map with live locations of trains and buses.
  - Crowding levels displayed for each vehicle or station.
  - Suggested alternate routes with estimated travel times.
- **User Preferences**:
  - Allow users to set favorite routes and receive custom alerts.

### Step 6: Testing and Optimization
- Simulate high-traffic scenarios (e.g., rush hour) to test predictions.
- Validate prediction accuracy using real-time and historical data.
- Optimize the system for low latency and high performance.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Storage**: HDFS (raw data), Hive (historical analysis), HBase (real-time queries).
- **Data Processing**: Spark for real-time and batch processing.
- **Data Ingestion**: Kafka for streaming real-time data from APIs.
- **Visualization**: Python (Dash, Flask), JavaScript (D3.js, React), or Tableau for the dashboard.

## Potential Challenges
1. **Real-Time Data Volume**:
   - Ensure Spark Streaming and Kafka are tuned for efficiency to handle high data volumes during peak times.
2. **Prediction Accuracy**:
   - Incorporate multiple factors (e.g., weather, delays) into predictive models to improve accuracy.
3. **API Latency**:
   - Account for potential delays in API responses and adjust predictions accordingly.

## Outcome
A functional, user-friendly CTA app that provides actionable insights into transit crowding and route optimization, benefiting both commuters and transit authorities.
